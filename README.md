- 👋 Hi, We are Organic Steel with @BASICSaaS
- 👀 We are interested in saving the world with sustainable products, our main company makes organic steel a hemp-based material that can replace steel in 80-90% of the applications.
- 🌱 We are currently learning how to make products from it.
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on ventures and projects, our software is a startup tailored rapid development software that has accounting software included and it makes it easy to sell you stocks as convertible notes or safes with the transparent accounting summaries for the investors.
- 📫 You can reach us via info@organicsteel.store
- 😄 Pronouns: make it better, make it sustainable.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Our project is located actually at gitlab: https://gitlab.com/basic-xaas/basic-saas-2.0.git
